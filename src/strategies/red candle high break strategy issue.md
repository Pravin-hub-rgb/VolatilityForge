# all issues with red candle high break strategy .. 

with the update we can't even call it red candle high break ...
we call it red candle high break with flexibiliyt..

1: if the red candle is too big then (8-9)... we are missing so much move... 
2: this issue is not related to this strtaetgy but the thing is that .. for premium less then 100-90 feels like 5 points sl is too much... 
    new rule that we only pick those premium which are higher than 110 that's it .. so that if later if they dip .. we will be in 90-100 range .. 


so what should happen if the reference candle bigger then the average let's say (7-8+) and if the next candle is green but we didn't entered the trade .. so now we enter if the next candle break the high of this green candle .. 
so like agar refernce candle ke next candle complete hone se pehle agar entry nahi mili 
case 1: next candle is green : we enter if this green cANDLE high is broken.. 
case 2: next candle is red .. we shift the reference

this is kinda getting complex 
another tricky situation
first red (reference with points more than 7 = open - close)
2 green (didin't broke the high of reference candle) (new reference)
3 red (high is lower then 1 + 2 candle .. ) now as this is red .. so this becomes reference now .. 
why because .. this case is there cuse that refrence candle is too big .. so in most cases with next 2 candles .. its hard to do breakout .. so don't trade next to this candle .. cuse in most cases that is spikes .. not a normal behaviour .. we only treade if new red candle appears ... or a green appear and there is continuation .. getting it?? big candle no trade in next trade .. only new red or green continaution trade getting it?? 

now what if there if big red candle .. so obiviously we dont' trade the very next candle if it breaks the high .. and 2nd candle high is higher then the red candle then?? we start again .. look for new red refernce candle 

one more rule .. 
for green candle the breakout shoulf happen the next candle onlyu ?? why cuse this is based on continutaion of green if next candle don't breakout .. then .. its a pause not a contiantuion .. we look for new reference from there... 

another stuff:
the green candle next to red reference's low should be .. higher then the reference red candle then only we shift??
